** Other less relevant questions
*** How do I clone that?
Since I make use of git submodules, you would have to set the recurse-submodules flag:

#+begin_src 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Nooo37/dots.git best-dots-Ive-ever-seen
#+end_src

*** Why that weird folder structure?
Don't feel like making my home directory a git repo. I also think it's clearer that way since I don't intend to backup everything.
*** Where have you stolen all that from?
I reused, got inspiration and stole stuff from [[https://github.com/javacafe01][javacafe]],[[https://github.com/elenapan/][ elenapan]] and some of my awesomeWM config structure comes from [[https://gitlab.com/bloxiebird/linux-awesomewm-modular-starter-kit/][Curt Spark]].
