# WINDOW MANAGEMENT
# w for closing: analogue to browser bindings, super+alt+c is pain
# h,j,k,l for movement, resizing, focus etc: more intuitive than 'tab'bing
# b,n,m for toggleing window properties
# z for switching between two tags: I only use two tags most times
# F keys for various things that I want to have around but don't need as often
